However, as is visible there are some issues such as: there still is a column with multiple entries in the same row, headings of columns are hard to understand(which would possibly make them hard to analyze), NaN was added to observations that were missing(which could be convenient if that is what you need) which may not be what our intended choice is regarding missingness (amongst other issues).\n",

    "If we knew the reactions(what they stand for) we pull those back in and then break them out into individual columns inside our data frame. I discussed this earlier in the notebook, as this could be used to track sentiment and engagment possibly. This also has me thinking what if we used participants in the call to the data frame constructor. This could allow us to track participant engagement levels. This could also allow us to track things like what their typical reactions are, what time do they usually respond, if they have many is_taken_down maybe that could tell us that they are a \"toxic\" user if it's the case that taken down means an admin deleted it, or if it's the case that it means the participant removed it themselves, maybe that tells us that they are indecisive. Or potentially show that certain users have high engagement with their messages, in which case we could (if we were a business) offer those participants some type of upgraded membership.\n",

    "Theoretically, we could create a dashboard with multiple different visualizations. However, a single visualization for this single data frame, could be a heat map. Something I can imagine wanting to understand is the timeing of users engagement. Therefore we could make the x-axis time of day (we woulad have to convert Unix ms to regular time which I would imagine is possible), then the y-axis can be participant names, the number of messages would be represented by a color(and also a number for further clarity). Now we can see where the people involved with this message are most or least active at certain times of days."
