This folder in the EMAT repo is to keep track of all files related to the final project as well as milestone notes.

Milestone 1

For Milestone 1, I set the goal of having collected and tidy the data needed for this project. I have a tidy data set already imported into my notebook. However, the inflation data is a little trickier to work with. I am having to learn some terminology to understand if the data I have found is what I am actually looking for. The two main sources I am looking at inflation data are the World Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank.

As mentioned in the notebook, I found a great dataset but then wanted to make sure that it was accurate, real-world, non-proprietary data. After tracking down the original sources I believe them to be credible and that the combined dataset represents the information accurately enough for our purposes. 

I am a history buff and so know the dates of many conflicts and world events. Though I do believe that I can find this information from a credible source. The question is can I find a miracle and someone has taken world events and conflicts and put them in a csv file with the date and name. Then I can use that to map certain events on the visuals.
